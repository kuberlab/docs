Project is the environment for development and lifecycle management of ML/AI application. You can find a lot of templates and pre-built Projects in the **Kibernetika** [catalog](../catalog/work-with-catalog.md#Install project from catalog). You can create new project using [UI interface](create-new-project.md#Creating empty project from UI interface) or [using command line tool](create-new-project.md#Creating empty project using **Kibernetika** command line tool).

### Creating empty project from UI interface
1. Open your workspace and select projects tab.
