A Project is the environment for development and lifecycle management of ML/AI application. You can find a lot of templates and pre-built Projects in the Kuberlab [catalog](/Catalog/Work With Catalog.md#Install project from catalog). You can create new project using [UI interface](Create New Project.md#Creating empty project from UI interface) or [using command line tool](Create New Project.md#Creating empty project using Kuberlab command lien tool).

### Creating empty project from UI interface.
1. Open your workspace and select projects tab.
