Data is the reason why analytics exists, and why we do machine learning. Without data, there is no need for any deep learning models. Since models exist only for processing and analyzing the data, the following observations about the data are true:

Data needs to be validated and secure. Without this, the results of models could be invalid, or worse, even malicious.

Model training is extremely time-consuming, since it happens with large amounts of data. If the data is properly pre-processed, this operation can significantly speed up the model training and increase the accuracy of the resulting model.

Data changes constantly, which means that the model will need to be re-trained regularly on a different version of the data set.

To generate repeatable results in model prediction, the operation needs to be done with the same data set.
